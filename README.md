# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
1. Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering is the systematic application of enginering approaches to the developments of software. it involoves the use of principles from the engineering and computer science to ensure software is reliable, efficient and meets the user requirements

2.  -What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

# The difference from traditional programming would be the scope and methodology:

Scope: software engineering includes a  broader range of activities,including requirement analysis,design,testing and maintenance,while traditional programming focuses mainly on writing code

Methodology: SE uses structured methodologies and tools to manage the complexity of large-scale software projects. traditional programming does not always follow a structured process

3. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
# PHASES OF THE SDLC 

1- Planning : 
 Identifying the scope,purpose and objectives of the projects.Resource allocation and project scheduling are done 

2 - Requirements Analysis: 
 Gather and document the functional and non-functional requirements of the software 

3 - Design :
 Create architectural designs and detailed design specifications for the sofware components 

4 - Implementation :
 Writing the actual code based on the design specs

5 - Testing:
 Verify that the software meets the specified requirements through varios levels of testing (unit testing ,intergration,systems testing ,acceptance)

6- Deployment : 
 Release the software to users and deploy it in the intended enviroment

7- Maintenance: 
 Perform ongoing maintenance to fix bugs,update features and improve performance. 

4. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

# Agile Model 

* Iterative and Incremental :Development is broken into small iterations and sprints 
* Flexibility :              Can adapt to changes even late inthe development 
* Customer Collaboration:    Continuos feedback from stakeholders
* Less Documentation :       Emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation 
* Team Collaboration :       Strong focus on teamwork over comprehensive documentation
* Use Case :                 Preferred projects with the uncertain with of rapidly changing requirements . 

# Waterfall Model : 

* Sequential : Development follows a linear path through defined phases.
      (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance).
* Rigid: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
* Clear Milestones : Each phase has specific deliverable and milestones
* Heavy Documentation : Heavy emphasis on documentation and planning. 
* Minimal Customer Interaction: Customer involvement is mainly at the beginning and end of the project
* Use Case : Suitable for projects with well-defined,stable requirements

# Suitable Scenarios for each model 

#  Agile Model 
 - Projects with uncertain requirements : ideal for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not well understood at the start
 - Rapid Development : Suitable for projects that require quick releases and frequent updates
 - Customer-Centric Projects: Works well when customer feedback is crucial and needs to be incorporated  regularly 

 # Waterfall Model
  - Well-Defined Requirements: Best for projects where requirement are clear , fixed and unlikey to change
  - Simple or Small Projects: Suitable for projects with straightforward objectives anf limited scope.
  - Regulated industries: Works well in industries where stringent documentation and process control are required(i.e aerospace , healthcare)
  - Budget and Time Contstraints: idea when project timelines and budgeta are fixed, and predictability is crucial

  # Agile and Waterfall Summary

  Agile is suitable for dynamic,customer-focused projects with envolving requirements while Waterfall is best for well -defined ,linear projects where requirement are stable and well understood from the outset. 

5. What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

RE bridges the gap between the initail concept of a software and its implementation,ensuring that the developed system fulfills intended purpose. 

# Process of Requirements Engineering
1 Elicitation : 
 - Objective: Gather requirements from the stakeholders through various techniques 
 - Techniques : Interviews, surveys,workshops ,observations,document anaylsis , and use cases. 
 - Outcome: Initial set of raw requirements 

2 Analysis: 
- Objective: Analyze and refine the gathered requirements to ensure they are clear,complets,consistent and feasible
- Technique: Requirements modeling,prototyping and validation with stakeholders
- Outcome: Detailed and structured requirements

3 Specification : 
- Objective: Ensure the requirements in a clear and precise manner. 
- Documents: Requirements specification document(SRS), use cases,user stories and models
- Outcomes: Formalized and detailed requirements ready for review and approval.

4 Validation : 
- Objective: Ensure the requirement accurately represent the stakeholders needs and are feasible to implement 
- Techniques: Reviews , inspections ,walk throughs and prototyping. 
- Outcome: Validated requirements that stakeholder agree on. 

5 Management: 
 - Objective: Handle chagnes to requirements as the project progresses

2 Encapsulation: 
- Explanation: Hides the internal details of modules of projects,exposing onlny the necessary interfaces
- Benefits: Protects the integrity of data and reduces complexity by limiting the interactions between different parts of the system. 

3 Abstraction: 
- Explanaion: Simplifies complex systems be modeling classes based on essential properties and behaviors,ignoring the unnecessary detailes
- Benefits: Enhances code readability and maintainability by allowing developers to focus on high-level concepts rahter than low-level implementation details

4 Separation of Concerns : 
Explaination: Divides a software system into distinct sections,each addresing a specific concern or aspect of the system. 
Benefit: Improves code organization adnd reduces the impact of changes by isolating different functionalities

5 Single Responsiblity Principle(SRP)
- Explanation: Each class or module should have only one reason to change,meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. 
- Benefits: Enhances maintainability and reduses the risk of introducing bigs by limiting the scope of changes. 

6 Open/Close Principle: 
- Explanation: Software entities should should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
- Benefit: Allows the behavior of a module to be extended without modifying its source code ,promoting reusability and robustness. 

7 Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP):
- Explanation: Objective of a surperclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness affecting the correctness of the program. 
- Benefit: Ensure that a derived class can be used interchangeably with its base class,promoting reliable inheritance an polymorphism. 
  # Polymorphism is a concept in programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common super type. It enables a single function or method to work in different ways based on the object it is acting upon.

8 Interface Segregation Principe(ISP):
 - Explanation: Clients should not be forced to depend on intefaces they do not use . 
 Benefit: Promoted the creation of smaller,more specific interfaces,enhancing flexibility and reducing the impact of changes. 
 - Benefit: Promotes the creation of smaller,more specific interfaces,enhancing flexibility and reducing the impact of changes 

9 Dependancy Inversion Principle(DIP):
 - Explanation: CLients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 
 - Benefit: Promotes the creation of smaller,more specific interfaces,enhancing flexibility and reducing the impact of changes.

10 DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself ):
- Explanation: Avoid code dupliction by abstracting common functionality into reusable components or function. 
- Benefits: Simplifies maintenance and reduces the risk of inconsistencies by ensuring that a change in one place propagates everywhere code is used. 

11 KISS(Keep It Simple Stupid):

- Explanation: Aim for simplicity in design and implementation , avoiding unnecessary complexity. 
- Benefit : Make the code easier to understand,maintain and debug. 

12 YAGNI(You arent gonna need it):
- Explanation: Do not add functionality until is necessary. 
- Benefits: prevents feature bloat and keeps the codebase lean and manageable. 

6. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

# Modularity in Software design 
Modularity is the design principle that involves breaking down a sofware system into smaller,self-contained units or modules. Each module encapsulates a specific piece of functinality and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces. 

- Explained: 
 Self-Contained Units: Each module has its own responsibilties and can function independ of other modules 
 Well-Defined interfaces: Module communicat with each other through specifies interfaces,which hide the internal implementation details of the modules
